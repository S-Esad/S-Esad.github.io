				<h2>I Have Spoken</h2>
				
				<p>Kuiil is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise who appears in the Disney+ television series The Mandalorian. An alien of the Ugnaught species, Kuiil is a former indentured servant of the Galactic Empire living in solitude when he encounters the show's title character and assists him in seeking and protecting a young alien known as "The Child".</p>

				<p>Kuiil is portrayed as wise, patient, and hard-working, with a high level of mechanical skills and a gruff but ultimately kind-hearted personality. The voice of Kuiil was performed by Nick Nolte, who completed his recordings for all the character's dialogue in a single afternoon. Kuiil's motion capture performance was done by Misty Rosas, who during filming wore a face mask created by a shop of prosthetic makeup experts started by Stan Winston.</p>

				<p>Kuiil's face was brought to life through animatronics and puppetry, with its electronics and wires concealed in the backpack and pockets of Kuiil's costume. Three puppeteers controlled the mask's mouth and eyebrows off-camera as Rosas performed her scenes, attempting to match the character's facial movements to Nolte's vocal tracks. The process often proved challenging, particularly when the puppeteers missed signals made by Rosas during dimly-lit scenes, and it was occasionally difficult for Rosas to breathe while wearing the mask.</p>

				<p>Kuiil's dynamic with the bounty hunter droid IG-11 reflects a parenting theme prevalent among multiple characters throughout the first season of The Mandalorian, and Kuiil's reprogramming of the droid from hunter to protector drew nature versus nurture discussions among reviewers. Kuiil has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike. He has been described as a fan favorite, with several reviews calling him the best character on the show, and his signature line "I have spoken" became one of the better-known and best-liked lines of dialogue from the series.</p>

				<p>Kuiil is an alien of the Ugnaught species.[1][2][3] According to his backstory established in exposition dialogue on The Mandalorian, Kuiil was sold into indentured servitude to the Galactic Empire and spent many years working for them against his will prior to the events of the television series.[1][4] At one point in the show, Kuiil says he worked in the gene farms of a cloning facility during his time with the Empire.[5][6] He eventually worked hard enough to pay off his debt and earn his freedom,[1][7][8] and then sought a reclusive home on a quiet world where he would no longer have to work for anyone else again.[1][7] Kuiil appeared in three episodes in the first season of The Mandalorian,[2] making his first appearance in the series debut episode "Chapter 1: The Mandalorian",[9][10][11] where he lives on a moisture farm on the planet Arvala-7,[1][2][12] working as a vapor farmer.[4][9][13]</p>
