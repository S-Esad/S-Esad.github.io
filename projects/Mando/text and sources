Mando Text

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(Star_Wars_character)

The Mandalorian is a sobriquet for Din Djarin,[1] a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise and the title character of the Disney+ series The Mandalorian. Orphaned as a young child, he was adopted into the Mandalorian culture and became a bounty hunter and warrior. Originally hired to capture "The Child", an infant of the same alien species as Yoda, the Mandalorian instead protects the Child from a remnant of the fallen Galactic Empire.

The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau created the character, partially inspired by Clint Eastwood and his Man with No Name character in the Spaghetti Western films directed by Sergio Leone. The samurai films of Akira Kurosawa was another inspiration, and Star Wars protagonist Han Solo also influenced the character's portrayal. The Mandalorian is voiced and primarily portrayed by Pedro Pascal. Favreau approached him for the role, and fellow actor Oscar Isaac urged Pascal to accept the part.

Pascal was working on multiple projects at the same time as The Mandalorian, so he does not appear in every episode. Actor Brendan Wayne and stunt performer Lateef Crowder portray the character when Pascal is unavailable. The Mandalorian's costume was created by Legacy Effects and bears similarities to Star Wars character Boba Fett, though the Mandalorian filmmakers deliberately sought to establish differences between the two costumes.

The costume presented challenges for the actors portraying the Mandalorian, and the physicality of the character is very important for the performance because small gestures appear much more exaggerated when the costume is worn. The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of parenting and fatherhood prevalent throughout The Mandalorian. The character and Pascal's performance have received generally positive reviews, with negative reviews criticizing the fact that Pascal's face is constantly concealed by the costume.


Baby Yoda
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Child_(Star_Wars)

The Child, colloquially known as "Baby Yoda" among fans and the media, is a fictional character from the Star Wars Disney+ original television series The Mandalorian. He is an infant member of the same unnamed alien species as the popular Star Wars character Yoda, with whom he shares a similarly strong ability with The Force. In the series, the protagonist known as "The Mandalorian" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen Galactic Empire, but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.

The Child and the Mandalorian are the only two characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer Dave Filoni, and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of animatronics and puppetry, although accentuated with computer-generated imagery.

The puppet was designed by Legacy Effects and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a bat-eared fox and kinkajou. The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of parenting and fatherhood prevalent in The Mandalorian, and the Child character has also raised questions about good and evil and nature versus nurture in the show.

The Child has received an overwhelmingly positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's breakout character, and quickly became a popular Internet meme. The Guardian called him "2019's biggest new character",[1] and The Hollywood Reporter has claimed the character "represents the future of Hollywood".[2] Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from The Mandalorian's prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but Bob Iger, Disney's CEO at the time of The Mandalorian's premiere, has defended the strategy.



Kuiil

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiil

Kuiil is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise who appears in the Disney+ television series The Mandalorian. An alien of the Ugnaught species, Kuiil is a former indentured servant of the Galactic Empire living in solitude when he encounters the show's title character and assists him in seeking and protecting a young alien known as "The Child".

Kuiil is portrayed as wise, patient, and hard-working, with a high level of mechanical skills and a gruff but ultimately kind-hearted personality. The voice of Kuiil was performed by Nick Nolte, who completed his recordings for all the character's dialogue in a single afternoon. Kuiil's motion capture performance was done by Misty Rosas, who during filming wore a face mask created by a shop of prosthetic makeup experts started by Stan Winston.

Kuiil's face was brought to life through animatronics and puppetry, with its electronics and wires concealed in the backpack and pockets of Kuiil's costume. Three puppeteers controlled the mask's mouth and eyebrows off-camera as Rosas performed her scenes, attempting to match the character's facial movements to Nolte's vocal tracks. The process often proved challenging, particularly when the puppeteers missed signals made by Rosas during dimly-lit scenes, and it was occasionally difficult for Rosas to breathe while wearing the mask.

Kuiil's dynamic with the bounty hunter droid IG-11 reflects a parenting theme prevalent among multiple characters throughout the first season of The Mandalorian, and Kuiil's reprogramming of the droid from hunter to protector drew nature versus nurture discussions among reviewers. Kuiil has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike. He has been described as a fan favorite, with several reviews calling him the best character on the show, and his signature line "I have spoken" became one of the better-known and best-liked lines of dialogue from the series.

Kuiil is an alien of the Ugnaught species.[1][2][3] According to his backstory established in exposition dialogue on The Mandalorian, Kuiil was sold into indentured servitude to the Galactic Empire and spent many years working for them against his will prior to the events of the television series.[1][4] At one point in the show, Kuiil says he worked in the gene farms of a cloning facility during his time with the Empire.[5][6] He eventually worked hard enough to pay off his debt and earn his freedom,[1][7][8] and then sought a reclusive home on a quiet world where he would no longer have to work for anyone else again.[1][7] Kuiil appeared in three episodes in the first season of The Mandalorian,[2] making his first appearance in the series debut episode "Chapter 1: The Mandalorian",[9][10][11] where he lives on a moisture farm on the planet Arvala-7,[1][2][12] working as a vapor farmer.[4][9][13]
